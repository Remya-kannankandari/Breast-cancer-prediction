# Breast Cancer Prediction App

## Overview

The Breast Cancer Prediction App is a Streamlit application that allows users to interactively input features and get predictions on whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The app utilizes a RandomForestClassifier trained on the Breast Cancer dataset from the `sklearn` library.

## Features

- **Interactive Sliders**: Users can adjust sliders to input features related to breast cancer tumors.
- **Model Prediction**: Displays the probability of the tumor being malignant or benign based on the input features.
- **Data Visualization**: Shows the user input features and the model's prediction results.
